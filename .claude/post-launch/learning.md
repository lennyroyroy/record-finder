# Learn How Spin or Stream Works

_A full coding course built around this app. For a beginner coder who wants to understand every concept, every file, and every line — well enough to rebuild it by hand._

---

## Intent

This course will cover:
- Every fundamental coding concept used in the app (React, Python, HTTP, APIs, CSS, localStorage, OAuth, deployment, etc.)
- Every piece of code in the codebase — what it does, why it's written that way, and how it connects to everything else
- Real examples pulled directly from Spin or Stream, not abstract textbook exercises
- Structured modules with timing, exercises, and prompts
- A final project goal: be able to code this app from scratch

**Status: Not started. Will be built after launch.**

## Scope (rough topics to cover)

_To be expanded into full modules when the course is built._

- How the web works (requests, responses, HTML/CSS/JS, client vs. server)
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, arrays, objects, async/await)
- React basics (components, props, state, hooks — useState, useEffect, useRef)
- CSS fundamentals (box model, flexbox, grid, variables, media queries)
- How this app's single-file architecture works (App.jsx, STYLES constant, why it's structured this way)
- localStorage — what it is, how the app uses it as a database, its limits
- Python and Flask basics (routes, JSON responses, environment variables)
- APIs — what they are, how to call them, rate limits, error handling
- The Discogs API — how the wantlist sync, marketplace search, and OAuth flow work
- OAuth 1.0a — what it is, why it's more complex than a simple login, how the token flow works
- Environment variables and secrets management
- Git and version control — branches, commits, cherry-pick, why `dev` and `main` exist
- Deployment — Netlify (frontend), Render (backend), how they connect, environment configs
- Debugging — DevTools, Network tab, localStorage inspector, console errors
