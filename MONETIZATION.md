# Spin or Stream — Monetization Philosophy

This document tracks decisions and constraints around future monetization.

## Core Principle

This app exists to help record collectors make smarter decisions about their Discogs wantlist.
Any monetization must align with that mission — not extract from it.

## Ruled Out

**Affiliate links to competing retailers (Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc.)**
- The app compares Discogs prices against retail alternatives to help users decide
- Adding affiliate revenue from those clicks would mean earning money when users leave Discogs
- This conflicts with the app's spirit and could strain the relationship with Discogs' API program
- Decision: never add affiliate codes to the "Find Elsewhere" buttons

## Possible Paths (Years Away)

These are early, unresearched ideas — not commitments.

- **Discogs affiliate program** — Discogs has its own affiliate/partner program for driving marketplace sales. Revenue from purchases made *on* Discogs after using this tool would align perfectly with the app's purpose.
- **Optional premium features** — e.g., price history tracking, collection value estimates, alerts when a wantlist item drops below a threshold. Free core tool, paid power features.
- **One-time tip / Buy Me a Coffee** — low friction, no recurring obligation, keeps the tool free.

## When Monetization Becomes Relevant

Before any monetization is added:
1. Review Discogs API commercial use terms (required once revenue is generated)
2. Add FTC disclosure if any affiliate or referral revenue exists
3. Review GDPR/CCPA requirements if user data is being stored server-side by then
